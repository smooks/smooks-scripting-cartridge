// tag::smooks-scripting-cartridge[]
Support for https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] scripting is made available through the `+https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/groovy-2.0.xsd+` configuration namespace.

Example configuration:

.smooks-config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<smooks-resource-list xmlns="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks-2.0.xsd"
                      xmlns:g="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/groovy-2.0.xsd">

    <g:groovy executeOnElement="xxx">
        <g:script>
        <!--
 //Rename the target fragment element from "xxx" to "yyy"...
 DomUtils.renameElement(element, "yyy", true, true);
 -->
        </g:script>
    </g:groovy>

</smooks-resource-list>

*Usage Tips*

. Imports can be added via the `+imports+` element. A number of classes are automatically imported:
* `+org.smooks.support.DomUtils+`
* `+org.smooks.api.bean.context.BeanContext+`
* `+org.smooks.api.bean.repository.BeanRepository+`
* `+org.w3c.dom.*+`
* `+groovy.xml.dom.DOMCategory+`, `+groovy.xml.dom.DOMUtil+`, `+groovy.xml.DOMBuilder+`
. The visited element is available to the script through the variable `+element+`. It is also available under a variable name equal to the element name, but only if the element name contains alpha-numeric characters only.
. By default, the script is executed on the _visitAfter_ event. You can direct it to be executed on the _visitBefore_ by setting the `+executeBefore+` attribute to `+true+`.
. If the script contains special XML characters, it can be wrapped in an XML Comment or CDATA section.

== Groovy Scriptlet Variables and Methods

A number of variables and methods are made directly available to groovy scriptlet code i.e. you can reference them directly in your scriptlet.

=== Variables

* `+element+`: The DOM/SAX Element (depending on which filter type is in use) i.e. `+org.w3c.dom.Element+` or `+org.api.smooks.delivery.sax.SAXElement+`.
* `+executionContext+`: The Smooks `+ExecutionContext+` instance associated with the Smooks filtering operation.
* `+nodeModels+`: A map containing all the DOM NodeModels currently available (i.e., `+Map<String, Element>+`).

=== Methods

* Get a bean from `+Object BeanContext#getBean(String beandId)+`.

== Adding Beans to the BeanContext

As shown above, all scriptlet code can access the beans by calling `+BeanContext#getBean(String)+` from inside the scriptlet code. One oversight when implementing this feature was that we didn't provide an `+addBean+` method for adding beans to the bean context. However, it is still possible to do so in a slightly more long-winded method via the `+executionContext+` e.g.:

[source,java]
----
executionContext.getBeanContext().addBean("myBean", myBeanInstance);
----
